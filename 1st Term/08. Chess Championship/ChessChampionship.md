The Zaragoza Chess Club must organize the next world championships that will be held in that town. For this reason, a database of all management related to participants, accommodation and games is required. It must be taken into account the following <strong>assumptions</strong>:

- Players and referees participate in the championship; of both it is required to know the number of membership, name, address, contact phone number and championships in which they have participated (as a player or as a referee).

- No referee can participate as a player.

- The countries send a set of players and referees to the championship, although not all countries send participants. Every player and referee is sent by a single country. A country may be represented by another country.

- Each country is identified by a correlative number according to its alphabetical order and interests to know in addition to its name, the number of existing chess clubs in it.

- Each game is identified by a correlative number (Cod_p), it is played by two players and the referee that arbitrates. It is interesting to record the games played by each player and the color (white or black) with whom he plays. It should be noted that a referee cannot arbitrate players sent by the same country that has sent him.

- Each player takes part in at least one game.

- Both players and referees stay in one of the hotels where the matches take place.

- You want to know in which hotel and on what dates each of the participants are hosted. Participants may not stay in Zaragoza for the entire championship, but go when they have to play a game staying in the same or different hotel. For each hotel, you want to know the name, address, and room phone number.

- The championship takes place over a series of days (year, month, day) and each game takes place on one of the days. There are days without games.

- Each game is held in one of the rooms available in the hotels, you want to know the number of tickets sold in the room for each game. from each room, you want to know the capacity and media available (radio, television...) to facilitate the broadcasting. A room can have several different media.

- The aim of each game is to record all the movements that compose it, the movement identification is established based on an order number within each game: for each movement are saved five positions and a brief comment done by an expert.

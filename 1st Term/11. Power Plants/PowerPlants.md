The Government needs a control system over the electric energy that is produced and consumed in our Country. Following assumptions are made:

- There are basic electricity producers identified by a name whose production data has to be recorded; average, maximum and minimum production. Besides that, the date of entry into service is also required.

- Those basic producers belong to one of these categories; Hydroelectric, Solar, Nuclear or Thermal. 
    - For hydroelectric centrals we need to know; current level, maximum capacity and number of turbines. 
    - For solar plants we need to know; total panels area, hours of sun per year and also the kind of solar plant; thermal or photovoltaic.
    - For nuclear plants; Number of reactors, plutonium consumed and tonnes of waste produced.
    - For thermal plants; Number of ovens, coal consumed and gas emissions.

- Due to National Security issues, the plutonium has to be controlled. For each plutonium supplier we need to know its name, country and the amount bought. Also, the carrier for each shipment has to be recorded; name and license plate number. Of course, any supplier can sell plutonium to different nuclear plants and each shipment can be made by different carriers.

- Each day, producers deliver energy to primary stations. These primary stations can receive each day different amounts of energy from each producer. Primary stations are identified by their name. Each one also has a number of current transformers from low to high voltage and they are leading one or more distribution networks.

- Producers deliver each day the total amount of energy produced.

- A distribution network is identified by an ID network number and only belongs to a primary station. However, any distribution network can be property of one or several electric companies, identified each one by its name.

- The excess energy from one distribution network can be sent to another network. The amount of energy exchanged between two networks has to be recorded.

- A network is composed of several lines, and each line is identified by a sequential number inside the network number ID and its longitude is recorded also. Any line will provide at least two sub-stations.
    • A sub-station is provided by just one line and it supplies to one or many service zones. For that reason, provinces (code and name recorded) are divided into service zones. Any service zone belongs to one province only, but one service zone can be provided by more than one sub-station. 
    • Each service zone has to record average consumption and the number of clients in one of the following categories: personal, business or public institution.

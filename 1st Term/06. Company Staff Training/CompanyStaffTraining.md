## Company Staff Training

A company wants to create a database about the running of training courses for its staff training system. Each staff member may attend a number of training courses and a training course must involve at least 5 staff members. A training course is run by either one, two or three trainers and each trainer will run one or more training courses. Each training course is held at just one venue and most (but not all) venues hold several training courses. Every training course involves just one course theme and course themes are involved in just one training course (with some themes recorded for some future allocation to an actual training course).

Staff member details to be recorded include staff number (unique), staff name, department and phone number. Trainer details include trainer code (unique), trainer name and phone number. Training course details include course code (unique), course date and length. Course Theme includes theme number (unique), theme name and theme area. Venue details include venue name (unique), capacity and distance. The outcome for each staff member who attends a particular course (i.e. pass/fail) is also recorded. The role of the trainer on each particular training course (lead, support, administration) is also recorded.

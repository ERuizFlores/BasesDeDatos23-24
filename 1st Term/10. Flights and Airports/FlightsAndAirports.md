Based on the following assumptions create the appropriate E-R Diagram:
1. A flight (identified uniquely by an ID) consists of one or more flight legs (identified uniquely by an ID), flight legs belong to one flight. 

2. Flight legs start at one airport (identified by its IATA code) and end at another airport.
Flight legs are parts of a daily flight leg combination (daily flight leg also have an ID). A daily flight leg combination is assigned to one aircraft type (Type ID) and an aircraft type is assigned to one daily flight leg combination.

3. An aircraft type can land at several airports.

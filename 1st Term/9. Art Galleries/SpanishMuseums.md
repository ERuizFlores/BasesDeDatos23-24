## Spanish Museums 

The Government has decided to register information about the paintings present in Art Galleries besides all information about them. Create the ER Diagram based on the following assumptions:

- For each Art Gallery is required: name (it is supposed to be unique), city, address and its surface.
- Each Art Gallery has a list of paintings and it is required to store about each one: code, name, measurements, date of production and technique used to paint it.
- Each painting is made by a specific artist, whose name, city, country, date of birth and date of death need to be stored. An artist could also have another artist as a teacher, and a teacher could be for several artists or none.
- An artist could be a member (or not) of a specific school. For each school the name, country and start and end dates.
- Artists could also have one or more patrons. For each one, the following data needs to be stored: name, country, city of birth, date of death, patronage start and end dates. Also, the patron could be for several artists. The relationship between patron and artist has to be recorded.
